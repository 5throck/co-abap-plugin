# Post-Write Mandatory Chain

Applies to all tools: **Claude Code CLI, Antigravity, Gemini CLI**

After ANY `WriteSource` / `EditSource` / `Activate`, the executing agent MUST run these four steps in order:

| Step | Tool | Pass Condition |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1 | `SyntaxCheck` | 0 errors |
| 2 | `RunUnitTests` | 0 failures |
| 3 | `GetCodeCoverage` | ≥ 70% statement coverage on the changed object (new objects); no regression vs. prior run (existing objects) |
| 4 | `RunATCCheck` | 0 Priority-1 findings |

## ATC Priority Levels

- **Priority 1 (Error)** → BLOCKS deployment — fix before `Activate`
- **Priority 2 (Warning)** → PM review required before proceeding
- **Priority 3 (Info)** → Log to task file only

## Code Coverage Gate (Step 3)

- **New objects** (class/program created this task): minimum **70%** statement coverage. Below threshold → write additional ABAP Unit tests before proceeding to `RunATCCheck`.
- **Existing objects** (modified, not created): coverage must not regress below the value recorded in the last QA report (`deliverables/REQ-NNN-*/04_qa_report.md` if tracked, else `memory/` log) for that object. A drop is treated the same as a coverage-threshold miss.
- **Disposition when coverage cannot reach 70%** (e.g. generated/boilerplate code, trivial getters): QA Engineer may waive with an explicit justification recorded in the QA report / memory log — never silently skip.
- Coverage is informational-only for GUI Scripter (BDC/VBS) objects, which `GetCodeCoverage` does not instrument.

## Output Format

Report each step result clearly:

```
✅ SyntaxCheck — PASSED
✅ RunUnitTests — PASSED (N tests, 0 failures)
✅ GetCodeCoverage — PASSED (82% statement coverage, threshold 70%)
✅ RunATCCheck — PASSED (0 Priority-1, 0 Priority-2, N Priority-3)
```

If any step fails:

```
❌ SyntaxCheck — FAILED
  Error: <error message>
  Line: <line number>
Action required: Fix the syntax error before proceeding.
```

```
❌ GetCodeCoverage — FAILED (54% statement coverage, threshold 70%)
Action required: Add ABAP Unit test cases covering the uncovered branches,
                  or record a waiver with justification in the QA report.
```

## Rules

1. Never skip SyntaxCheck — even for "trivial" one-line changes.
2. If SyntaxCheck fails, fix the code and re-run before proceeding to RunUnitTests.
3. If RunUnitTests fails, do not run GetCodeCoverage or RunATCCheck until the test logic is fixed.
4. If GetCodeCoverage falls below threshold (or regresses on an existing object) without a recorded waiver, do not proceed to RunATCCheck.
5. Priority-1 ATC findings block all further steps including transport release.
6. In Gemini / Antigravity sessions: route all four steps through `sap_execute` with `"action": "SyntaxCheck"`, `"action": "RunUnitTests"`, `"action": "GetCodeCoverage"`, `"action": "RunATCCheck"`.

## Claude Code Desktop App Note

`PostToolUse` hooks do **not** fire automatically in the Desktop App. Run all three steps of this chain manually after each write in Desktop sessions using `/post-write <object-name>`.
