# Desktop App Post-Write Fallback

## When to Use

Use this skill when working in the **Claude Code Desktop App**, where `PostToolUse` hooks do not fire automatically.

## Trigger

After any `WriteSource` or `EditSource` operation in the Desktop App.

## Manual QA Chain

Run the following command manually after each write operation:

```
/post-write
```

This command runs the complete QA chain:
- SyntaxCheck
- RunUnitTests
- RunATCCheck

## Expected Results

| Step | Required | Action on Fail |
|------|:--------:|----------------|
| Syntax Check | ✅ Pass | Fix syntax errors, re-run |
| Unit Tests | ⚠️ Best effort | Fix bugs if critical |
| ATC Check | ✅ P1 must pass | Fix P1 findings, document P2/P3 |

## After QA Pass

1. Sync changes: `/sync`
2. Create transport if needed: `/transport`
