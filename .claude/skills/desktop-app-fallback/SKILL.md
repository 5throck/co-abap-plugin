# Desktop App Post-Write Fallback

## When to Use

Use this skill when working in the **Claude Code Desktop App**, where `PostToolUse` hooks do not fire automatically.

## Trigger

After any `WriteSource` or `EditSource` operation in the Desktop App.

## Manual QA Chain

Run the following commands manually after each write operation:

```bash
# 1. Syntax Check
vsp syntax check --object "<object_url>"

# 2. Run Unit Tests
vsp test run --object "<object_url>"

# 3. Run ATC Check
vsp atc run --object "<object_url>"
```

## Or Use the Combined Script

```bash
bun scripts/post-write.ts "<object_url>"
```

## Expected Results

| Step | Required | Action on Fail |
|------|:--------:|----------------|
| Syntax Check | ✅ Pass | Fix syntax errors, re-run |
| Unit Tests | ⚠️ Best effort | Fix bugs if critical |
| ATC Check | ✅ P1 must pass | Fix P1 findings, document P2/P3 |

## After QA Pass

1. Sync changes: `bun scripts/sync-mcp.ts`
2. Commit: `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts "description"

## Context

The Claude Code Desktop App does not automatically fire `PostToolUse` hooks after write operations, meaning the standard post-write QA chain is bypassed. This skill provides a manual fallback so developers can still enforce syntax checking, unit testing, and ATC validation after every ABAP write operation in Desktop App sessions.

## Execution Steps

1. **Syntax Check** — Run `vsp syntax check --object "<object_url>"` and verify pass.
2. **Unit Tests** — Run `vsp test run --object "<object_url>"` and review results.
3. **ATC Check** — Run `vsp atc run --object "<object_url>"` and ensure no Priority-1 findings.
4. Alternatively, run the combined script: `bun scripts/post-write.ts "<object_url>"`.
5. After QA passes, sync changes with `bun scripts/sync-mcp.ts` and commit with `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts`.

## Output Format

Pass/fail result for each QA step:
- Syntax Check: Pass required; fix and re-run on failure.
- Unit Tests: Best effort; fix critical bugs.
- ATC Check: Priority-1 must pass; document Priority-2/3 findings.
