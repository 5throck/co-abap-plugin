A Claude Code plugin providing a complete **AI Harness Engineering** framework for SAP ABAP development. Includes 20 specialized agents, 15 skills, 7 commands, and MCP integration via the `vsp` server.

> **What is Harness Engineering?**
> A methodology where specialized AI agents collaborate within a structured environment - ensuring AI-driven SAP development is predictable, governed, and auditable. The PM-led governance model mirrors a real software engineering team: business analysts define requirements, architects design the solution, developers implement it, and QA verifies it. See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/5throck/abap_vibe_coding).

---

## Features

- **20 Agents**: Global PM, technical architect, code writer, DBA, interface expert, DevOps/admin, Fiori developer, form expert, GUI scripter, security monitor, business analysts (SD/MM/FI/CO/PP/LE), QA runner, schema inspector, SAP investigator, read-only analyst
- **15 Skills**: ABAP development workflows, post-write quality gate, desktop app fallback, dump monitoring, performance tuning, meeting facilitation, project review, session celebration, dev-sync pipeline, and 6 SAP ERP module knowledge bases (SD, MM, FI, CO, PP, LE)
- **7 Commands**: `/triage`, `/transport`, `/post-write`, `/sync`, `/new-task`, `/memlog`, `/celebrate`
- **MCP Integration**: `vsp` server for full SAP ADT access in hyperfocused mode
- **Bun Scripts**: Cross-platform TypeScript scripts (~50ms startup, single-source maintenance)

---

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI or Desktop App
- SAP system with ADT (ABAP Development Tools) access
- `vsp` binary (see Installation below)

---

## Installation

For a step-by-step walk-through on installing, registering the plugin hooks, and connecting your first consumer repository, please see:

* **[docs/plugin-setup.md](./docs/plugin-setup.md)**

### 1. Install the vsp Binary

**Unix/macOS:**
```bash
bash scripts/install-vsp.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\install-vsp.ps1
```

To install a specific version, pass the tag:
```bash
bash scripts/install-vsp.sh v2.38.1        # Unix/macOS
.\scripts\install-vsp.ps1 -Version v2.38.1 # Windows
```

### 2. Configure SAP Connection

See **[config/README.md](./config/README.md)** for detailed setup instructions.

Quick setup for manual installation:
```bash
cp config/env.sample .env
cp config/mcp.json.sample .mcp.json
```

Edit `.env` with your SAP credentials:
```bash
export SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:8080
export SAP_USER=your-username
export SAP_PASSWORD=your-password
export SAP_CLIENT=100
```

Or set them in your shell profile / Claude Code environment.

### 3. Install the Plugin

**Local testing:**
```bash
# Set CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT environment variable to test plugin locally
export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/path/to/co-abap-plugin
# Then run Claude Code CLI from your consumer project directory
```

**From Marketplace:**
1. Open Claude Code
2. Go to **Settings → Plugins → Browse**
3. Search for **"co-abap-plugin"**
4. Click **Install → Enable**
5. Enter SAP credentials when prompted

### Plugin vs Standalone Mode

| Feature | Plugin Mode | Standalone Mode |
|---------|-------------|:---------------:|
| SAP Credentials | UI prompt (userConfig) | .env file |
| Documentation | Built-in | External docs/ |
| Hooks | Auto-registered | Manual setup |
| Updates | Via marketplace | Manual git pull |

## Usage

### Quick Start - Triage a Task

```
/triage Fix the SD billing report for customer 1000
```

This will:
1. Detect the SD module automatically
2. Create a task file in `scratch/tasks/`
3. Generate parallel dispatch blocks for 3 read-only agents

### Transport Management

```
/transport list
/transport create feat: add ZCL_MY_CLASS
/transport add NPL_K000001 /sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/ZPROG_EXAMPLE
/transport release NPL_K000001
```

### Quality Gate

```
/post-write ZCL_MY_CLASS
```

### Sync to Git

```
/sync feat: implement SD billing fix
```

## Architecture

### Harness Engineering Workflow

```
Phase 1 (Parallel): sap-investigator + read-only-analyst + schema-inspector
        |
Phase 2 (Serial):   architect -> code-writer
        |
Phase 3 (Serial):   test-runner
        |
Phase 4:            /post-write -> /transport release -> /sync
```

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Phase | Parallelizable |
|-------|-------|:--------------:|
| pm | 1 | Serial |
| sap-investigator | 1 | Parallel |
| read-only-analyst | 1 | Parallel |
| schema-inspector | 1 | Parallel |
| security-monitor | 1 | Parallel |
| sd/mm/fi/co/pp/le-analyst | 1 | Parallel |
| architect | 2 | Serial |
| dba | 2 | Parallel |
| interface-expert | 2 | Parallel |
| code-writer | 2 | Serial |
| fiori-developer | 2 | Design parallel / write serial |
| form-expert | 2 | Design parallel / write serial |
| gui-scripter | 2 | Serial |
| test-runner | 3 | Serial after write |
| devops-admin | 4 | Serial |

## MCP Configuration

The plugin provides MCP configuration assets and integration. Note that the consumer project still needs `.mcp.json` or target environment variables configured in its root directory to initialize the connection. The server runs in `hyperfocused` mode with access to `Z*`, `$TMP`, `$ZADT_VSP`, and `$VSP_ADT` packages.

Supported features:
- `SAP_FEATURE_ABAPGIT=on` - abapGit integration
- `SAP_FEATURE_TRANSPORT=on` - CTS transport management
- `SAP_FEATURE_UI5=on` - Fiori/UI5 support
- `SAP_FEATURE_RAP=on` - ABAP RESTful Application Programming

In addition to the `vsp` server, the provided MCP configuration sample includes two documentation MCP servers:
- `abap-docs` - ABAP language reference and object search via [mcp-abap.marianzeis.de](https://mcp-abap.marianzeis.de)
- `sap-docs` - SAP Help Portal search via [mcp-sap-docs.marianzeis.de](https://mcp-sap-docs.marianzeis.de)

---

## Hooks

In Claude Code CLI sessions, a `PostToolUse` hook fires after every Write/Edit tool call and runs `scripts/sync-md.ts` for documentation audit.

> **Note**: Hooks do not fire in Claude Code Desktop App. Run `/post-write` manually after each ABAP write in Desktop sessions. Also, note that automatic hooks rely on the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable being populated by the plugin runtime. For direct manual testing or execution outside the hook lifecycle, execute `bun scripts/sync-md.ts` directly from your workspace root.

---

## TypeScript Scripts (Bun)

This project uses **TypeScript via Bun** as the single source of truth for all utility and orchestration scripts:

1. **Utility Scripts**: `sync-md.ts`, `audit.ts`, `dev-sync.ts`, `setup.ts`, `vsp-task.ts`, `vsp-publish.ts` — cross-platform via Bun runtime.
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent workflow coordination (`dispatch.ts`, `dispatch-parallel.ts`, `dispatch-serial.ts`).
3. **Bootstrap Scripts**: `install-bun.sh/.ps1` and `install-vsp.sh/.ps1` remain as native shell scripts (run before Bun is installed).

See `scripts/README.md` for complete documentation.

### Prerequisites for Agent Orchestration

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1"
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Usage

```bash
# Utility Scripts (TypeScript via Bun)
bun scripts/dev-sync.ts "feat: description"
bun scripts/audit.ts
bun scripts/sync-md.ts

# Agent Orchestration Scripts
bun scripts/dispatch.ts parallel
bun scripts/verify-skills.ts
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **vsp command not found** | Run `bash scripts/install-vsp.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows) |
| **Hooks not firing** | Desktop App limitation - use `/post-write` manually |
| **SAP connection failed** | Check `.env` file or MCP server configuration |
| **Plugin not loading** | Verify `.claude/settings.local.json` has `"enableAllProjectMcpServers": true` |
| **Agent not responding** | Check [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for trigger keywords |

## Standalone Plugin Architecture

This plugin is the packaged, distributable form of the **[5throck/abap_vibe_coding](https://github.com/5throck/abap_vibe_coding)** project.

Unlike typical lightweight plugins, this repository is designed as a **standalone, fully-featured framework**. When installed in a consumer's repository, AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity) will read from the plugin's internal `docs/`, `agents/`, and `skills/` directories.

The plugin is fully self-contained and ships with the complete Harness Engineering documentation, including:
- Comprehensive `docs/context.md`
- Module-specific `task-template.md` and `prd-template.md`
- Code testing and security guidelines
- The full `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` configurations

> The upstream reference project (`abap_vibe_coding`) contains live scratch files, memory logs, and session history from real development work. This plugin contains the distilled intelligence and governance structure to replicate that workflow in any SAP project.
