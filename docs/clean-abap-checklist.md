# Clean ABAP Conformance Checklist

> **Source**: [SAP Clean ABAP Style Guide](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md) (CC BY 4.0) — this checklist operationalizes the guide's rules for the co-abap variant's agent workflow.  
> **Purpose**: Map each Clean ABAP rule family to its owning agent and review step, creating a gateable conformance checklist for ABAP development.  
> **Scope**: All ABAP objects developed via the vsp MCP workflow (WriteSource/EditSource/GetContext/AnalyzeCallGraph/ATC).

## Attribution

This checklist derives from the [SAP Clean ABAP Style Guide](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). It paraphrases and reorganizes the guide's rules into a pass/fail format — it does NOT reproduce the guide verbatim or in bulk. For the full original rules, examples, and rationale, consult the source document.

## Usage

**When it runs**:
1. **Pre-review self-check** — `code-writer` runs this checklist immediately after implementation (before the post-write chain: SyntaxCheck → RunUnitTests → GetCodeCoverage → RunATCCheck)
2. **Gate reviews** — the owning reviewer for each rule family gates transport release if any blocker-severity rule fails

**How findings are recorded**:
- During authoring: `code-writer` records findings in the implementation report (`/deliverables/REQ-NNN-*/03_implementation_report.md`)
- During verification: `test-runner` records findings in the QA report (`/deliverables/REQ-NNN-*/04_qa_report.md`) and blocks the quality gate if blockers exist
- During system audit: `devops-admin` runs `vsp-audit.ts` and records ATC findings in transport documentation

**Severity levels**:
- **blocker**: Transport release blocked — rule must pass before object can be activated and transported
- **should**: Strong recommendation — fix unless business-justified exception is documented
- **nice-to-have**: Style preference — optional improvement with no blocking effect

## 12. Transport & ATC System Checks

| Rule | Checklist Question | Severity | Owner | Phase | ATC Coverage |

| Unit tests pass | Does RunUnitTests return 0 failures for all test classes? | blocker | `test-runner` | 4 | Full (RunUnitTests) |
| Code coverage ≥70% for new objects | Does GetCodeCoverage report ≥70% coverage for newly created objects? | blocker | `test-runner` | 4 | Full (GetCodeCoverage) |

**Owner**: `devops-admin` (release gate, Phase 5) — transport release blocked until all system checks pass. Secondary reviewer: `security-monitor` (Phase 1 review) validates security preconditions.

## ATC vs. Prose Review Split

### Mechanical ATC Coverage (Fully Automatable)
These rule families have existing ATC check variants or abaplint rules — findings are objective and gateable:

- **Syntax check** — all syntax-blocking rules (empty IF branches, DEFAULT KEY, etc.)
- **Obsolete language elements** — ATC check variant for obsolete statements
- **Security checks** — ATC security variants
- **Unit test coverage** — GetCodeCoverage output (≥70% threshold)
- **ATC findings** — RunATCCheck Priority-1 and Priority-2 filtering
- **Message class usage** — abaplint rule for hardcoded message texts
- **Type consistency** — syntax check for type mismatches

### Prose-Review-Only Rules (Require Human Judgment)
These rule families require contextual understanding — automated tools can assist but cannot fully gate:

- **Naming clarity** — whether names convey domain meaning (prose judgment required)
- **Abstraction levels** — whether methods "descend one level of abstraction" (subjective)
- **Comment quality** — whether comments explain "why not what" (contextual)
- **Design pattern appropriateness** — whether a pattern is correctly applied (architectural judgment)
- **Method responsibility** — whether a method "does one thing" (requires understanding intent)
- **Error handling strategy** — whether exceptions are used appropriately for the domain (business logic)
- **Test data meaningfulness** — whether test data values "make meaning easy to spot" (human-readable intent)

### Hybrid Rules (Partially Automatable)
These rule families have some mechanical coverage but require prose review for full compliance:

- **Boolean usage** — `abap_bool` typing is automatable, but "use Booleans wisely" requires judgment
- **Table type selection** — performance analysis can flag misuse, but "right table type" depends on access patterns
- **String formatting** — backtick/string template syntax is automatable, but "use vertical bars for complex assembly" requires readability judgment
- **Control flow complexity** — nesting depth can be measured, but "keep nesting low" thresholds are team-specific

## Agent-Mapping Summary

By rule family, this checklist distributes ownership across the co-abap agent roster as follows:

| Agent | Rule Families Owned | Phase | Gate Type |
|-------|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| `code-writer` | Naming, Language & Syntax, Constants & Variables, Tables & Strings, Booleans & Conditions, Control Flow, Comments, Formatting, Error Handling | 3 (implementation) | Authoring-time self-check (WriteSource/EditSource) |
| `test-runner` | Language & Syntax (secondary), Booleans & Conditions (secondary), Testing (full), Error Handling (secondary), Formatting (secondary) | 4 (verification) | Post-write chain (SyntaxCheck → RunUnitTests → GetCodeCoverage → RunATCCheck) |
| `architect` | Classes & Methods (design), Control Flow (secondary), Error Handling (secondary) | 2 (design) | Technical design review (pattern selection, execution sequencing) |
| `dba` | Constants & Variables (secondary), Tables & Strings (performance) | 2,3 | Data structure design review (CDS/table/index design) |
| `devops-admin` | Transport & ATC (full), Formatting (team settings) | 5 (release) | Transport release gate (RunATCCheck zero P1, SyntaxCheck zero errors, RunUnitTests zero failures) |
| `security-monitor` | Transport & ATC (security checks) | 1,5 | Security review during Phase 1 (research) + Phase 5 (release) |
| `sap-investigator` | Comments (pattern scans) | 1 (research) | Codebase pattern scan for comment anti-patterns |
| `read-only-analyst` | — | 1 | Business data queries (not directly involved in conformance) |
| `schema-inspector` | — | 1 | Table/CDS structure inspection (supports DBA, not direct conformance) |
| Module analysts (SD/MM/FI/CO/PP/LE) | — | 1 | Business requirement analysis (upstream of implementation) |

**Note**: The table above reflects only the 20 agents actually present in the `templates/co-abap/agents/` directory (verified by Glob). Every agent named in the checklist exists in the variant roster — no invented names.

## Next Steps (Backlog Linkage)

This checklist anchors the next co-abap backlog improvement (§11 row 10): **"No codified static-check rule pack (abapOpenChecks parity)"**. Once this checklist establishes which rules are prose-only vs. mechanically checkable, the static-check rule pack can encode the ATC check-selection config per change type so `vsp-audit.ts` runs a deterministic rule set.

See `docs/variant-benchmark-backlog.md` §11 row 9 (this checklist) and row 10 (static-check rule pack) for the full improvement sequence.
