# GEMINI.md

**vsp** —Go-native MCP server and CLI for SAP ABAP Development Tools (ADT).

> This file contains **Gemini-specific overrides only**.
> All shared dev context (build commands, codebase map, current priorities, common issues,
> ABAP rules, security) lives in [docs/context.md](docs/context.md) and applies to all AI tool sessions equally.
> Read `docs/context.md` first, then apply the overrides below.

## Context Loading

Load project files at session start using the `@` syntax:
*(Ref: `docs/context.md` -> `Initial Context Files`)*

```
@docs/context.md                            # full project knowledge (ABAP rules, build, codebase map)
@AGENTS.md                                  # canonical agent roster
@memory/MEMORY.md                           # recent changes (skip if file does not exist)
@skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md                   # SAP development workflows
@skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md           # mandatory QA chain after any write
```

## Gemini-Specific Configuration

### Recommended Mode

Use `--mode hyperfocused` for all Gemini sessions. In hyperfocused mode all 101 MCP operations are accessible via `sap_execute`; the single entry point reduces tool-selection hallucinations without restricting capability.

```bash
vsp mcp --mode hyperfocused
```

### Settings File

Gemini reads `.gemini/settings.json` in the project root. Confirm `mcpServers.abap.args`
contains `["--mode", "hyperfocused"]` before starting a session.

### Tool Usage in Hyperfocused Mode

All operations are routed through `sap_execute` with an `action` parameter:

```json
{ "action": "GetSource", "object_type": "PROG", "name": "ZPROG_SBOOK_QUERY" }
{ "action": "EditSource", "object_url": "/sap/bc/adt/...", "old_string": "...", "new_string": "..." }
{ "action": "GrepPackages", "packages": ["$TMP"], "pattern": "ZPROG_" }
```

See [docs/mcp_usage.md](docs/mcp_usage.md) for the full tool catalog and parameter reference.

## Gemini Skill Additions

The following capabilities extend those in [skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md](skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md):

- **Role-Based Execution**: Switch between Business and Technical roles defined in `AGENTS.md`
  by explicitly stating the active role at the start of a task.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Delegate long-running research to background sessions;
  keep write operations (EditSource, WriteSource) in the primary session.
- **Advanced Diagnostics**: Use `vsp health` to validate architecture and
  `vsp slim` for context optimization before large read sessions.
- **Post-Write Test Chain**: Hooks are not supported. After any write operation, execute the mandatory chain manually via `sap_execute` as defined in `docs/context.md`.
  ```json
  { "action": "SyntaxCheck",   "object_url": "/sap/bc/adt/..." }
  { "action": "RunUnitTests",  "object_url": "/sap/bc/adt/..." }
  { "action": "RunATCCheck",   "object_url": "/sap/bc/adt/..." }
  ```

## Gemini Tool Safeguards

#### 🚨 Surgical Multi-Replace Offset Safeguard
When calling `multi_replace_file_content` with multiple `ReplacementChunks`, the line numbers of subsequent target blocks will shift if previous edits change the line count.
- **Rule**: Sort and process `ReplacementChunks` from the **bottom of the file to the top** (descending order of line numbers: largest `StartLine` first).

#### 🚨 Grep Search 50-Match Cap Safeguard
The `grep_search` tool silently truncates results at exactly **50 matches**.
- **Rule**: If a search yields 50 results, do **NOT** assume you have all occurrences.
- **Remediation**: Partition the search by targeting specific subdirectories or applying restrictive file glob filters via the `Includes` parameter (e.g., `["*.go"]`).

## Gemini-Specific Workflows

### 1. Planning Mode & Artifact Specifications
For complex tasks or architectural modifications, Gemini must enter **Planning Mode**. Leverage these three Markdown artifacts (set `IsArtifact: true` with accurate metadata):

#### 1a. `implementation_plan.md`
*Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\implementation_plan.md`*
- **Purpose**: Detailed technical design document presented to the user for feedback and approval.
- **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "implementation_plan"`, `RequestFeedback: true`.
- **Governance**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval before modifying any code.

#### 1b. `task.md`
*Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\task.md`*
- **Purpose**: Running TODO list to track development progress dynamically.
- **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "task"`.
- **Syntax**: `- [ ]` uncompleted · `- [/]` in progress · `- [x]` completed.

#### 1c. `walkthrough.md`
*Path: `<appDataDir>\brain\<session-id>\walkthrough.md`*
- **Purpose**: Post-implementation document summarizing changes, test logs, and manual validation details.
- **Metadata**: `ArtifactType: "walkthrough"`.

After changes are verified, summarize outcomes in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### 2. Executing Custom Commands
Unlike Claude Code, Gemini does not natively register local custom slash commands from `.gemini/commands/` or `.claude/commands/`. Instead:
- Automation workflows like `/sync`, `/memlog`, `/project-review`, or `/meeting` are simulated or executed directly as project scripts (e.g., executing `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts` via terminal tools).
- System-provided slash commands (like `/goal`, `/schedule`, `/browser`, `/grill-me`) can be recommended to the user.

### 3. Coexistence, Precedence & Migration of .claude
This project contains a `.claude/` directory. To prevent configuration drift and avoid issues when transitioning away from Claude Code, Gemini follows these rules:
- **Absolute Precedence**: `.gemini/` always takes absolute precedence over `.claude/`. If `.gemini/` exists, `.claude/` is ignored by Gemini to prevent duplicate or conflicting configurations.
- **Fallback (Coexistence Phase)**: If a project lacks a `.gemini/` directory but contains `.claude/`, Gemini will temporarily read and respect `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.claude/commands/` as the fallback source of truth.
- **Graceful Migration**: If the project transitions fully away from Claude Code, or if Gemini needs to write new project-level settings/commands, Gemini should proactively offer to migrate the `.claude/` configuration to `.gemini/` (copying and adapting files) rather than leaving legacy files orphaned.
- **Command Emulation**: Custom slash commands defined as markdown files in `.claude/commands/` must be emulated by Gemini. Read the `.md` file to understand the underlying script execution and run those commands directly via terminal tools.
- **Gemini Integration Rule**: Gemini can dynamically instantiate roles defined in `AGENTS.md` using `define_subagent` and `invoke_subagent`.

#### Define Subagent (`define_subagent`)
```json
{
  "name": "abap-analyst",
  "description": "Read-only ABAP code analysis and dependency mapping",
  "system_prompt": "You are an ABAP code analyst...",
  "enable_write_tools": false,
  "enable_subagent_tools": false
}
```

#### Invoke Subagent (`invoke_subagent`)
```json
{
  "Subagents": [
    {
      "TypeName": "abap-analyst",
      "Role": "ABAP Analyst",
      "Prompt": "Analyze dependencies of ZPROG_SBOOK_QUERY in package $TMP"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Communication (`send_message`)
Interact with spawned agents via their unique `conversationID`.
**Reactive Wakeup**: Do not poll in a loop —simply yield execution and the platform wakes you automatically when an agent replies or a background task completes.


#### Superpowers Plugin & Cost Optimization (3-Tier Strategy)
The PM agent MUST leverage the **`superpowers`** plugin (e.g., `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`) for multi-agent harness engineering using a 3-tier model strategy:
**Model Selection Overrides** (overridden per subagent invocation when appropriate):
- **High-tier (Design/Planning)** → `gemini-3.1-pro` (Parameter: `thinking_level="medium"`): Complex reasoning, architectural design, planning, and PM orchestration.
- **Medium-tier (Review/QA)** → `gemini-3.5-flash` (Parameter: `thinking_level="medium"`): Code review, testing, PR review, and quality gates (`verification-before-completion`). Supervises the Low-tier.
- **Low-tier (Execution/Coding)** → `gemini-3.5-flash` (Parameter: `thinking_level="low"`): Fast, repetitive coding, boilerplate generation, or strictly scoped sub-agent tasks.

---

### Optimal Interaction Guidelines
- **Context Management**: Leverage your massive context window by cross-referencing multiple files simultaneously (e.g., when debugging, review log files along with related code).
- **Tool Usage**: Actively use tools like `search_web` for real-time package version verification or resolving external dependencies.

### 4. Language Policy for Documentation

All `.md` files you create or modify MUST be in English, except in `ko/` or `locales/ko/` directories (Korean translation zones) or when explicitly declared as a Korean legal/regulatory content exception.

- README.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, context.md, CHANGELOG.md — English only
- All documentation in docs/, agents/, skills/ — English only
- Git commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions — English only
- Branch names — English only
- Code comments — English (unless documenting locale-specific logic)

#### Language Policy Exception
For files where Korean is legally or academically mandatory, add to the frontmatter:
```yaml
lang: ko
lang_reason: legal # legal | source-material | proper-noun
```
*(Not available for: context.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, or any variant context.md)*

## Execution Plan Boilerplate

The execution plan table format, the Design Gate (Row 0) rule, exemption categories, and the `/sync`-as-final-step rule are the Single Source of Truth in **[AGENTS.md §5.1 Standard Execution Plan Template](AGENTS.md#51-standard-execution-plan-template)** and **[§5.1.1 Design Gate Exemptions](AGENTS.md#511-design-gate-exemptions)** — do not restate them here.

> **Note (Antigravity-specific)**: Use the literal Gemini model ID (e.g. `gemini-3.1-pro`) in the `Model` column, not a Claude-style short alias.

**Antigravity execution**: Use `invoke_subagent` for specialist dispatch. See §3 (Subagent Instantiation & Async Orchestration) in this file.

## Git & PR Additions (Gemini)

All shared Git/PR rules are in [docs/context.md](docs/context.md). Gemini-specific additions:

- **Platform Hook Support**: Gemini CLI supports BeforeTool/AfterTool/PreCompress hooks (stdin(JSON) → stdout(JSON)). AfterTool runs `bun scripts/hooks/post-write-lifecycle-check.ts --platform gemini` after every write_file/replace_file_content/multi_replace_file_content. Antigravity does NOT fire hooks (VS Code extension limitation). Claude Desktop App uses bundled CLI (hooks should fire per Anthropic docs, but workspace testing observed intermittent behavior). If hooks are not firing in your environment, run `bun scripts/hooks/post-write-lifecycle-check.ts` manually before committing.
- **Commit Protection (SYNC_ACTIVE)**: Direct `git commit` or `git push` calls via `run_command` are **FORBIDDEN**. The pre-commit hook blocks direct commits unless executed through `/sync`. Never manipulate environment variables (e.g., `$env:SYNC_ACTIVE=1; git commit`) to bypass QA gates. If you see `[FAIL] Direct git commits are restricted`, run `/sync \"type: description\"` instead. **`--no-verify` is forbidden** — it bypasses secret scanning and all quality gates.
- **Sequential Branch Dependency Rule**: Before running `/sync` to open a new PR while a prior PR from the same session is still open and unmerged, merge the prior PR first (or explicitly justify parallel branching in a plan/design doc). `dev-sync.ts` touches shared pipeline files (CHANGELOG.md, memory logs, VERSION_MANIFEST.md, generated READMEs) on every commit, so unmerged parallel branches conflict by default, not by exception. Full rule: context.md §3.3.
- **PR Language**: Governed by [docs/context.md](docs/context.md). All PR titles, bodies, and review comments must be written in English - no exceptions.
- **Windows: Git Bash required**: `.githooks/` hook files are Unix shell scripts. Windows users must have Git Bash installed. Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to activate hooks. All `scripts/` operational scripts are TypeScript (`.ts`) — run via `bun scripts/<name>.ts`. No `.sh/.ps1` counterparts (ADR-0036).

## Pre-Edit Quality Gate (All Platforms)

Before editing any file for the **FIRST time in a session**, the agent MUST:

1. Search for all files that import or require the target file
2. Identify data schemas, interfaces, and type definitions the file exports
3. Review the user's instructions for explicit scope constraints
4. Briefly summarize findings (1-3 sentences) before proceeding

| Platform | Enforcement | Details |
|----------|:-----------:|---------|
| Gemini CLI | ✅ Hook (automatic) | BeforeTool `deny` mode — blocked until agent investigates |
| Antigravity | ✅ Prompt (manual) | Hooks do not fire — agent self-enforces |

If the hook is not active (Antigravity), agents must still follow the 4-step process before making first edits.
