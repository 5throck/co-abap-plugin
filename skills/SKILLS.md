Skills are auto-discovered from the `skills/` directory at session start.

To add a new skill:
1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `metadata.type`, `metadata.triggers`
3. Add corresponding command files in `.claude/commands/` and `.gemini/commands/`
4. Skill will be automatically discovered

> **Note**: Commands (changelog, memlog, new-task, post-write, transport, triage, celebrate)
> are registered as slash commands in `.claude/commands/` and `.gemini/commands/`, not as skills.
